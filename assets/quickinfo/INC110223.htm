style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#333333'>Income in
the Past 12 Months - Income of Households: This includes the income of the
householder and all other individuals 15 years old and over in the household,
whether they are related to the householder or not. Because many households
consist of only one person, average household income is usually less than
average family income. Although the household income statistics cover the past
12 months, the characteristics of individuals and the composition of households
refer to the time of interview. Thus, the income of the household does not
include amounts received by individuals who were members of the household
during all or part of the past 12 months if these individuals no longer resided
in the household at the time of interview. Similarly, income amounts reported
by individuals who did not reside in the household during the past 12 months
but who were members of the household at the time of interview are included.
However, the composition of most households was the same during the past 12
months as at the time of interview.</span></p>

divides the income distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases
falling below the median income and one-half above the median. For households
and families, the median income is based on the distribution of the total

income for individuals is based on individuals 15 years old and over with
income. Median income for households, families, and individuals is computed on

form of margins of error for all estimates included with ACS and PRCS published

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#333333'>As
mentioned above, ACS estimates are based on a sample and are subject to
sampling error. The margin of error measures the degree of uncertainty caused
by sampling error. The margin of error is used with an ACS estimate to
construct a confidence interval about the estimate. The interval is formed by
adding the margin of error to the estimate (the upper bound) and subtracting
the margin of error from the estimate (the lower bound). It is expected with 90
percent confidence that the interval will contain the full population value of
the estimate. The following example is for demonstrating purposes only. Suppose
the ACS reported that the percentage of people in a state who were 25 years and
older with a bachelor's degree was 21.3 percent and that the margin of error
associated with this estimate was 0.7 percent. By adding and subtracting the
margin of error from the estimate, we calculate the 90-percent confidence
interval for this estimate:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#333333'>21.3% -
0.7% = 20.6% =&gt; Lower-bound estimate<br>
21.3% + 0.7% = 22.0% =&gt; Upper-bound estimate</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#333333'>Therefore,
we can be 90 percent confident that the percent of the population 25 years and
older having a bachelor's degree in a state falls somewhere between 20.6
percent and 22.0 percent.</span></p>
