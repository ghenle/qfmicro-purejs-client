<p>The Transportation and Warehousing sector includes industries providing transportation of passengers and cargo, warehousing and storage for goods, scenic 
and sightseeing transportation, and support activities related to modes of transportation. Establishments in these industries use transportation equipment or 
transportation related facilities as a productive asset. The type of equipment depends on the mode of transportation. The modes of transportation are air, rail, 
water, road, and pipeline.<p> 

<p>The Transportation and Warehousing sector distinguishes three basic types of activities: subsectors for each mode of transportation, a subsector for warehousing 
and storage, and a subsector for establishments providing support activities for transportation. In addition, there are subsectors for establishments that provide 
passenger transportation for scenic and sightseeing purposes, postal services, and courier services.</p> 

<p>For firms subject to payment of federal income tax, receipts/revenues are the total amounts received from customers or clients for services rendered and 
merchandise sold during the calendar year whether or not payment was actually received during the year regardless of when services were rendered. Receipts 
do not include sales, occupancy, admissions, or other taxes collected from customers and remitted directly by the firm to a local, state or federal tax agency.</p> 

<p>For firms or organizations exempt from federal income tax, receipts/revenues are charges or billings to customers or clients for services rendered and 
merchandise sold during the calendar year whether or not payment was actually received during the year. Also, included are income from interest, dividends, 
contributions, gifts and grants, rents, royalties, dues and assessments form members and affiliates, and net receipts from fund-raising activities. Receipts from 
these organizations' taxable business activities, as well as tax-exempt activities, are included.</p>
