<p>The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the number of housing units for each year since the most recent decennial census. With each annual release of housing unit estimates, the entire time
series of estimates beginning with April 1, 2010 is revised and updated. Housing unit estimates are produced for all states and counties.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</p></strong>

<p>A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters.
Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building 
or through a common hall. </p>
