&quot;at work,&quot; that is, those who did any work at all during the
reference week as paid employees, worked in their own business or profession,
worked on their own farm, or worked 15 hours or more as unpaid workers on a
family farm or in a family business; or (2) were &quot;with a job but not at
work,&quot; that is, those who did not work during the reference week but had
jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent due to illness, bad
weather, industrial dispute, vacation, or other personal reasons. Excluded from
the employed are people whose only activity consisted of work around the house

form of margins of error for all estimates included with ACS and PRCS published

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#333333'>As
mentioned above, ACS estimates are based on a sample and are subject to sampling
error. The margin of error measures the degree of uncertainty caused by
sampling error. The margin of error is used with an ACS estimate to construct a
confidence interval about the estimate. The interval is formed by adding the
margin of error to the estimate (the upper bound) and subtracting the margin of
error from the estimate (the lower bound). It is expected with 90 percent
confidence that the interval will contain the full population value of the
estimate. The following example is for demonstrating purposes only. Suppose the
ACS reported that the percentage of people in a state who were 25 years and
older with a bachelor's degree was 21.3 percent and that the margin of error
associated with this estimate was 0.7 percent. By adding and subtracting the
margin of error from the estimate, we calculate the 90-percent confidence
interval for this estimate:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#333333'>21.3% -
0.7% = 20.6% =&gt; Lower-bound estimate<br>
21.3% + 0.7% = 22.0% =&gt; Upper-bound estimate</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#333333'>Therefore,
we can be 90 percent confident that the percent of the population 25 years and
older having a bachelor's degree in a state falls somewhere between 20.6
percent and 22.0 percent.</span></p>
