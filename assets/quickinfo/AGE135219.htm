<P><STRONG>Population Estimates Program</STRONG></P>
<P>Age estimates of the population are produced for the United States, states, 
and counties, as well as for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its municipios 
(county-equivalents for Puerto Rico). Because age is a critical element in 
determining federal funding, it is imperative to have high quality age data.

<P>Age estimates of the population are produced for places, zona urbanas and 
comunidades (place-equivalents for Puerto Rico), and minor civil divisions. </P>
<P>Data on age are used to determine the applicability of other questions for a 
particular individual and to classify other characteristics in tabulations. Age 
data are needed to interpret most social and economic characteristics used to 
plan and analyze programs and policies.   </P>
