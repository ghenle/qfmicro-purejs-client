Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the
U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on
self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire
generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and
not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically.
In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include
racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report
more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as &quot;American
Indian&quot; and &quot;White.&quot; People who identify their origin as
Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#333333'>OMB requires five minimum categories (White, Black or
African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian
or Other Pacific Islander) for race.  OMB permits the Census Bureau to
also use a sixth category - Some Other Race. Respondents may report more than
one race.</span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
