<P>The Census Bureau produces health insurance data from three surveys and one 
model-based program. Depending on your needs, one data source may be more 
suitable than another data source.  A chart summarizing the recommendations at 
various geographic levels is located on this page: <A href="https://www.census.gov/topics/health/health-insurance/guidance.html"> 
Guidance for Data Users</A>    Included in this chart is the Survey of Income

<P>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey 
(CPS ASEC) provides annual, calendar-year, national estimates of health 
insurance coverage. The Census Bureau conducts the ASEC over a 3 month period, 
in February, March, and April, with most data collection occurring in the month 
of March. The CPS, sponsored jointly by the Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, is the country's primary source of labor force statistics for 
the civilian, non-institutional population.</P><BR>

<P>The ACS is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities with reliable 
and timely demographic, social, economic and housing estimates every year. The 
PRCS is part of the Census Bureau's ACS, customized for Puerto Rico.  The ACS is 
a nationwide survey designed to provide communities with reliable and timely 
demographic, social, economic and housing estimates every year. The ACS provides 
a wide range of important statistics about people and housing for every 
community across the United States and Puerto Rico, of which this Fact is one.  
These surveys are the only source of local estimates for most of the 40 topics 
it covers such as education, occupation, language, ancestry, and housing costs, 
and provides information for even the smallest communities. Estimates are 
available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, 
every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and 
places with populations of 65,000 or more. One-year estimate includes 
information collected from independent monthly samples from the previous 12 
months.</P><A href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html">Data

<P>The U.S. Census Bureau's SAHIE program produces timely estimates for all 
counties and states by detailed demographic and income groups. SAHIE is only 
source of single-year health insurance coverage estimates for all U.S. counties. 
  The SAHIE program models health insurance coverage by combining survey data 
with population estimates and administrative records from the following sources: 
American Community Survey (ACS); demographic population estimates; aggregated 
federal tax returns; participation records for the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program (SNAP); County Business Patterns; Medicaid and the Children's 
Health Insurance Program (CHIP) participation records; and Census 2010.</P><A

<P>The ACS is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities with reliable 
and timely demographic, social, economic and housing estimates every year. The 
PRCS is part of the Census Bureau's ACS, customized for Puerto Rico.  The ACS 
produces estimates for numerous social, economic and housing characteristics 
including language, education, the commute to work, employment, mortgage status 
and rent, as well as income, poverty and health insurance.  A multi-year 
estimate is simply a period estimate that encompasses more than one calendar 
year.  In the case of ACS multi-year estimates, the period is either three or 
five calendar years. While a one-year estimate includes information collected 
from independent monthly samples over a 12-month period, a five-year estimate 
includes information collected over a 60-month period. These estimates are 
available for all areas regardless of population size, down to the block 
group.</P><A href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html">
