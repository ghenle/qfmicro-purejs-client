<H2>Median Selected Monthly Owner Costs - Housing units with a mortgage and 
without a mortgage.</H2>
<P><STRONG>Sources:</STRONG> U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS) 
and  Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS), 5-Year Estimates. The PRCS is part of 
the Census Bureau's ACS, <A href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about/puerto-rico-community-survey.html"> 
customized for Puerto Rico.</A> Both Surveys are updated every year.</P>
<P><STRONG>Definition</STRONG></P>
<P>Selected monthly owner costs are the sum of payments for mortgages, deeds of 
trust, contracts to purchase, or similar debts on the property (including 
payments for the first mortgage, second mortgages, home equity loans, and other 
junior mortgages); real estate taxes; fire, hazard, and flood insurance on the 
property; utilities (electricity, gas, and water and sewer); and fuels (oil, 
coal, kerosene, wood, etc.). It also includes, where appropriate, the monthly 
condominium fee for condominiums  and mobile home costs  (installment loan 
payments, personal property taxes, site rent, registration fees, and license 
fees). Selected monthly owner costs were tabulated for all owner-occupied units, 
and usually are shown separately for units "with a mortgage" and for units 
"without a  mortgage.  For the complete definition, go to <A href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/subject_definitions/2020_ACSSubjectDefinitions.pdf">

<P><STRONG>Source and Accuracy</STRONG></P>
<P>This Fact is based on data collected in the American Community Survey (ACS) 
and the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS) conducted annually by the U.S. 
Census Bureau.  A sample of over 3.5 million housing unit addresses is 
interviewed each year over a 12 month period.  This Fact (estimate) is based on 
five years of ACS and PRCS sample data and describes the average value of 
person, household and housing unit characteristics over this period of 
collection.</P>
<P>Statistics from all surveys are subject to sampling and nonsampling error. 
Sampling error is the uncertainty between an estimate based on a sample and the 
corresponding value that would be obtained if the estimate were based on the 
entire population (as from a census).  Measures of sampling error are provided 
in the form of margins of error for all estimates included with ACS and PRCS 
published products. The Census Bureau recommends that data users incorporate 
this information into their analyses, as sampling error in survey estimates 
could impact the conclusions drawn from the results. The data for each 
geographic area are presented together with margins of error at <A href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/training-presentations/acs-moe.html"> 
Using margins of error.</A> A more detailed explanation of margins of error and 
a demonstration of how to use them is provided below.</P>
<P>For more information on sampling and estimation methodology, confidentiality, 
and sampling and nonsampling errors, please see the Multiyear Accuracy (US) and 
the Multiyear Accuracy (Puerto Rico) documents at "Documentation - <A href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html"> 
Accuracy of the data</A>."</P>
<P><STRONG>Margin of Error</STRONG></P>
<P>As mentioned above, ACS estimates are based on a sample and are subject to 
sampling error.  The margin of error measures the degree of uncertainty caused 
by sampling error. The margin of error is used with an ACS estimate to construct 
a confidence interval about the estimate.  The interval is formed by adding the 
margin of error to the estimate (the upper bound) and subtracting the margin of 
error from the estimate (the lower bound).  It is expected with 90 percent 
confidence that the interval will contain the full population value of the 
estimate.  The following example is for demonstrating purposes only. Suppose the 
ACS reported that the percentage of people in a state who were 25 years and 
older with a bachelor's degree was 21.3 percent and that the margin of error 
associated with this estimate was 0.7 percent. By adding and subtracting the 
margin of error from the estimate, we calculate the 90-percent confidence 
interval for this estimate:</P>
<P>21.3% - 0.7% = 20.6% =&gt; Lower-bound estimate <BR> 21.3% + 0.7% = 22.0% 
=&gt; Upper-bound estimate</P>
<P>Therefore, we can be 90 percent confident that the percent of the population 
25 years and older having a bachelor's degree in a state falls somewhere between 
20.6 percent and 22.0 percent.</P>
