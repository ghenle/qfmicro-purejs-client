<p>The Retail Trade sector comprises establishments engaged in retailing merchandise, generally without transformation, and rendering services incidental to the 
sale of merchandise.</p>

<p>The retailing process is the final step in the distribution of merchandise; retailers are, therefore, organized to sell merchandise in small quantities to the general 
public. This sector comprises two main types of retailers: store and nonstore retailers.</p>

<p>Sales include merchandise sold for cash or credit at retail and wholesale by establishments primarily engaged in retail trade; amounts received from customers 
for layaway purchases; receipts from rental of vehicles, equipment, instruments, tools, etc.; receipts for delivery, installation, maintenance, repair, alteration, 
storage, and other services; the total value of service contracts; and gasoline, liquor, tobacco, and other excise taxes which are paid by the manufacturer or 
wholesaler and passed on to the retailer.</p>

<p>Sales are net after deductions for refunds and allowances for merchandise returned by customers. Trade-in allowances are not deducted from sales. Sales do 
not include carrying or other credit charges; sales (or other) taxes collected from customers and forwarded to taxing authorities; gross sales and receipts of 
departments or concessions operated by other companies; and commissions or receipts from the sale of government lottery tickets.</p> 

<p>Sales do not include retail sales made by manufacturers, wholesalers, service establishments, or other businesses whose primary activity is other than retail 
trade. They do include receipts other than from the sale of merchandise at retail, such as service receipts, sales to industrial users, and sales to other retailers by 
establishments primarily engaged in retail trade.</p>
