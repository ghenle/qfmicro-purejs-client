<p>An establishment is a single physical location at which business is conducted or
where services or industrial operations are performed. It is not necessarily
identical with a company or enterprise, which may consist of one establishment
or more. When two or more activities are conducted at a single location under a
single ownership, all activities are generally grouped together as a single
establishment and classified on the basis of its major activity. Establishments
with paid employees include all locations with paid employees any time during the
year. (A separate data item, Nonemployer establishments, provides the number of
establishments without paid employees, (mostly self-employed individuals.)
Establishment counts represent the number of locations with paid employees any
time during the year. This series excludes government establishments except for
wholesale liquor establishments (NAICS 4248), retail liquor stores (NAICS
44531), Book publishers (NAICS 511130), Federally-chartered savings
institutions (NAICS 522120), Federally-chartered credit unions (NAICS 522130),
and hospitals (NAICS 622).</p>

<p>Paid employment (Mid-march employment) consists of full- and part-time employees,
including salaried officers and executives of corporations, who are on the
payroll in the pay period including March 12. Included are employees on paid
sick leave, holidays, and vacations; not included are proprietors and partners
of unincorporated businesses.</p>

<p>Employment percent change is computed by subtracting the previous year's employment figure
from the current year employment figure; this result is then divided by the
previous year's employment figure to obtain the percentage change.</p>

<p>Payroll includes all forms of compensation, such as salaries, wages, commissions,
dismissal pay, bonuses, vacation allowances, sick-leave pay, and employee
contributions to qualified pension plans paid during the year to all employees.
For corporations, payroll includes amounts paid to officers and executives; for
unincorporated businesses, it does not include profit or other compensation of
proprietors or partners. Payroll is reported before deductions for social
security, income tax, insurance, union dues, etc. This definition of payroll is
the same as that used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on Form 941 as
taxable Medicare Wages and Tips (even if not subject to income or FICA tax).
First-quarter payroll consists of payroll during the January-to-March quarter.</p>

<p><strong>Scope and Methodology: </p></strong>

<p>Figures for employer establishments with paid employees for the U.S. Puerto Rico and
the Island Areas are published in County Business Patterns (CBP), an annual
statistical series. Basic data items are extracted from the Business Register,
a file of all known single and multiestablishment companies maintained and
updated by the Bureau of the Census from various Census Bureau programs, such
as the 5-year Economic Census, the annual Company Organization Survey, the
Annual Survey of Manufactures, and Current Business Surveys, as well as from
administrative records of the Internal Revenue Service, Bureau of Labor Statistics,
and the Social Security Administration.</p>

<p>Employers without a fixed location within a state (or of unknown county location) are
included under a "Statewide" classification at the end of the county
tables. This incomplete detail causes only a slight understatement of county
employment.</p>
