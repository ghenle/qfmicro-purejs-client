owned), or condominium unit) would sell for if it were for sale. If the house
was owned or being bought, but the land on which it sits was not, the
respondent was asked to estimate the combined value of the house and the land.
Owners of noncondominium multi-unit buildings who live in one of the building’s
units, like duplexes and small apartment buildings, should report the value of
the building, the land, and any additional buildings on the same plot of land.
For vacant units, value was the price asked for the property. </span></p>

<b>Owner-Occupied</b> - A housing unit is owner-occupied if the owner or co-owner lives in the unit,
even if it is mortgaged or not fully paid for. The owner or co-owner must live
in the unit and usually is Person 1 on the questionnaire. The unit is
&quot;Owned by you or someone in this household with a mortgage or loan&quot;
if it is being purchased with a mortgage or some other debt arrangement such as
a deed of trust, trust deed, contract to purchase, land contract, or purchase
agreement. The unit also is considered owned with a mortgage if it is built on
leased land and there is a mortgage on the unit. Mobile homes occupied by
owners with installment loan balances also are included in this category. For

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#333333'>As
mentioned above, ACS estimates are based on a sample and are subject to
sampling error. The margin of error measures the degree of uncertainty caused
by sampling error. The margin of error is used with an ACS estimate to
construct a confidence interval about the estimate. The interval is formed by
adding the margin of error to the estimate (the upper bound) and subtracting
the margin of error from the estimate (the lower bound). It is expected with 90
percent confidence that the interval will contain the full population value of
the estimate. The following example is for demonstrating purposes only. Suppose
the ACS reported that the percentage of people in a state who were 25 years and
older with a bachelor's degree was 21.3 percent and that the margin of error
associated with this estimate was 0.7 percent. By adding and subtracting the
margin of error from the estimate, we calculate the 90-percent confidence
interval for this estimate:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#333333'>21.3% -
0.7% = 20.6% =&gt; Lower-bound estimate<br>
21.3% + 0.7% = 22.0% =&gt; Upper-bound estimate</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#333333'>Therefore,
we can be 90 percent confident that the percent of the population 25 years and
older having a bachelor's degree in a state falls somewhere between 20.6
percent and 22.0 percent.</span></p>
