<P>All of these data sources provide estimates at geographic levels other than 
the ones listed. Below is a chart which provides a summary of the data source 
recommendations by geographic level.  Included in this chart is the Survey of 
Income and Program Participation (SIPP), a longitudinal survey (changes in 
poverty status for the same household over time). <A href="https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income/guidance/data-sources.html">

<P><STRONG>How the Census Bureau measures poverty:</STRONG>  The Census Bureau 
poverty definition - Following the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) 
Statistical Policy Directive 14, the Census Bureau uses a set of money income 
thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in 
poverty. If a family's total income is less than the family's threshold, then 
that family and every individual in it is considered in poverty. The official 
poverty thresholds do not vary geographically, but they are updated for 
inflation using Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). The official poverty definition 
uses money income before taxes and does not include capital gains or noncash 
benefits (such as public housing, Medicaid, and food stamps).  For more

<P><STRONG>Data at a national level - Current Population Survey Annual Social 
and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC).</STRONG></P>

<P>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey 
(CPS ASEC) provides annual, calendar-year, national estimates of income and 
official poverty numbers and rates. Census Bureau conducts the ASEC over a 3 
month period, in February, March, and April, with most data collection occurring 
in the month of March. The CPS, sponsored jointly by the Census Bureau and the 
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, is the country's primary source of labor force 
statistics for the civilian, non-institutional population.</P>

<P><STRONG>Data at the state level - American Community Survey (ACS), 1-year estimates</STRONG></P>

<P>The ACS is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities with reliable and timely demographic, social, economic and housing estimates every year.
The PRCS is part of the Census Bureau's ACS, customized for Puerto Rico.
The ACS is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities with reliable and timely demographic, social, economic and housing estimates every year.
The ACS provides a wide range of important statistics about people and housing for every community across the United States and Puerto Rico, of which this Fact is one.
These surveys are the only source of local estimates for most of the 40 topics it covers such as education, occupation, language, ancestry, and housing costs, and provides information for even the smallest communities.
Estimates are available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more.
ACS 1-year estimate includes information collected from independent monthly samples from the previous 12 months.</P>

<P><STRONG>Data at a county level - Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates SAIPE)</STRONG></P>

<P>The U.S. Census Bureau's SAIPE program provides annual estimates of income 
and poverty statistics for all school districts, counties, and states. The main 
objective of this program is to provide estimates of income and poverty for the 
administration of federal programs and the allocation of federal funds to local 
jurisdictions. In addition to these federal programs, state and local programs 
use the income and poverty estimates for distributing funds and managing programs.</P>

<P>These estimates combine data from administrative records, postcensal 
population estimates, and the decennial census with direct estimates from the 
American Community Survey to provide consistent and reliable single-year estimates.</P>

<P><STRONG>Data at a sub-county level - American Community Survey (ACS) and Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS), 5-year estimates</STRONG></P>

<P>The ACS is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities with reliable and timely demographic, social, economic and housing estimates every year.
The PRCS is part of the Census Bureau's ACS, customized for Puerto Rico.
The ACS produces estimates for numerous social, economic and housing characteristics including language, education, the commute to work, employment, mortgage status and rent, as well as income, poverty and health insurance.
These surveys are the only source of local estimates for most of the 40 topics it covers such as education, occupation, language, ancestry, and housing costs, and provides information for even the smallest communities.
A multi-year estimate is simply a period estimate that encompasses more than one calendar year.
In the case of ACS multi-year estimates, the period is five calendar years.
While a 1-year estimate includes information collected from independent monthly samples over a 12-month period, a 5-year estimate includes information collected over a 60-month period.
These estimates are available for all areas regardless of population size, down to the block group.</P>
