<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p> 

<p>The Health Care and Social Assistance sector comprises establishments providing health care and social assistance for individuals. The sector includes both 
health care and social assistance because it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the boundaries of these two activities. The industries in this sector are 
arranged on a continuum starting with establishments providing medical care exclusively, continuing with those providing health care and social assistance, and 
finally finishing with those providing only social assistance. Establishments in this sector deliver services by trained professionals. All industries in the sector 
share this commonality of process, namely, labor inputs of health practitioners or social workers with the requisite expertise. Many of the industries in the sector 
are defined based on the educational degree held by the practitioners included in the industry.</p> 

<p>Excluded from this sector are aerobic classes in Subsector 713, Amusement, Gambling, and Recreation Industries, and non-medical diet and weight reducing 
centers in Subsector 812, Personal and Laundry Services. Although these can be viewed as health services, these services are not typically delivered by health 
practitioners.</p>

<p>Receipts (basic dollar volume measure for service establishments of firms subject to federal income tax). Includes gross receipts from customers or clients 
for services provided, from the use of facilities, and from merchandise sold in the census year, whether or not payment was received in the census year.</p>

<p>Receipts are net after deductions for refunds and allowances for merchandise returned by customers. Receipts do not include sales and other taxes (including 
Hawaii's General Excise Tax) collected directly from customers and paid directly to a local, state, or federal tax agency.</p>

<p>Revenue (basic dollar volume measure for firms exempt from federal income tax). Includes receipts from customers or clients for services provided in the census 
year, whether or not payment was received in the census year, and gross sales of merchandise, minus returns and allowances.</p>

<p>Revenue does not include sales and other taxes (including Hawaii's General Excise Tax) collected from customers and paid directly by a firm to a local, state, or 
federal tax agency.</p>

<p>Receipts from taxable business activities of firms exempt from federal income tax (unrelated business income) are also included in revenue.</p>

<p>Revenue does not include sales and other taxes collected directly from customers or clients and paid directly to a local, state, or federal tax agency; gross 
receipts of departments or concessions operated by others; and amounts transferred to operating funds from capital or reserve funds.</p>
