<P>QuickFacts uses data from the following sources: National level - Current 
Population Survey, Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC); State level 
- American Community Survey (ACS), one-year estimates; County level - The Small 
Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE), one-year estimates; Sub-county level: 
Cities, towns and census designated places; - ACS, five-year estimates; Puerto 
Rico and its municipios (county-equivalents for Puerto Rico) and  its 
sub-counties (zonas urbanas and comunidades); <A href="https://census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about/puerto-rico-community-survey.html"> 
Puerto Rico Community Survey</A>  (PRCS), five-year estimates.</P>
<P>All of these data sources provide estimates at geographic levels other than 
the ones listed. Below is a chart which provides a summary of the data source 
recommendations by geographic level.  Included in this chart is the Survey of 
Income and Program Participation (SIPP), a longitudinal survey (changes in 
poverty status for the same household over time). <A href="https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income/guidance/data-sources.html">

<P><STRONG>How the Census Bureau measures poverty:</STRONG>  The Census Bureau 
poverty definition - Following the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) 
Statistical Policy Directive 14, the Census Bureau uses a set of money income 
thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in 
poverty. If a family's total income is less than the family's threshold, then 
that family and every individual in it is considered in poverty. The official 
poverty thresholds do not vary geographically, but they are updated for 
inflation using Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). The official poverty definition 
uses money income before taxes and does not include capital gains or noncash 
benefits (such as public housing, Medicaid, and food stamps).  For more

<P><STRONG>Data at a national level - Current Population Survey Annual Social 
and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC).</STRONG></P>
<P>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey 
(CPS ASEC) provides annual, calendar-year, national estimates of income and 
official poverty numbers and rates. Census Bureau conducts the ASEC over a 3 
month period, in February, March, and April, with most data collection occurring 
in the month of March. The CPS, sponsored jointly by the Census Bureau and the 
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, is the country's primary source of labor force 
statistics for the civilian, non-institutional population.</P>

Community Survey (PRCS), one-year estimates.</STRONG></P>
<P>The ACS is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities with reliable 
and timely demographic, social, economic and housing estimates every year. The 
ACS provides a wide range of important statistics about people and housing for 
every community across the United States and Puerto Rico, of which this Fact is 
one. These surveys are the only source of local estimates for most of the 40 
topics it covers such as education, occupation, language, ancestry, and housing 
costs, and provides information for even the smallest communities. Estimates are 
available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, 
every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and 
places with populations of 65,000 or more. One-year estimates include 
information collected from independent monthly samples from the previous 12 
months.</P><A href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html">Data

<P><STRONG>Data at a county level - Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates 
(SAIPE)</STRONG></P>
<P>The U.S. Census Bureau's SAIPE program provides annual estimates of income 
and poverty statistics for all school districts, counties, and states. The main 
objective of this program is to provide estimates of income and poverty for the 
administration of federal programs and the allocation of federal funds to local 
jurisdictions. In addition to these federal programs, state and local programs 
use the income and poverty estimates for distributing funds and managing 
programs.</P>
<P>These estimates combine data from administrative records, postcensal 
population estimates, and the decennial census with direct estimates from the 
American Community Survey to provide consistent and reliable single-year 
estimates.</P><A href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe.html">Small

<P><STRONG>Data at a Sub-county level - American Community Survey (ACS) and 
Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS), five-year estimates.</STRONG></P>
<P>The ACS and PRCS produce estimates for numerous social, economic and housing 
characteristics including language, education, the commute to work, employment, 
mortgage status and rent, as well as income, poverty and health insurance.  A 
multi-year estimate is simply a period estimate that encompasses more than one 
calendar year. While a one-year estimate includes information collected from 
independent monthly samples from the previous 12 months, a five-year estimate 
includes information collected over a 60-month period. These estimates are 
available for all areas regardless of population size, down to the block 
group.</P><A href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html">Data
