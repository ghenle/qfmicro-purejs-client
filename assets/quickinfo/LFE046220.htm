<H2>In Civilian Labor Force, female, percent (population 16 years and over)</H2>
<P><STRONG>Sources:</STRONG> U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS) 
and  Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS), 5-Year Estimates. The PRCS is part of 
the Census Bureau's ACS, <A href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about/puerto-rico-community-survey.html"> 
customized for Puerto Rico.</A> Both Surveys are updated every year.</P>
<P><STRONG>Definition</STRONG></P>
<P>Civilian Labor Force consists of people classified as employed or unemployed 
in accordance with the criteria described below.</P>
<P>Employed - This category includes all civilians 16 years old and over who 
either (1) were "at work," that is, those who did any work at all during the 
reference week as paid employees, worked in their own business or profession, 
worked on their own farm, or worked 15 hours or more as unpaid workers on a 
family farm or in a family business; or (2) were "with a job but not at work," 
that is, those who did not work during the reference week but had jobs or 
businesses from which they were temporarily absent due to illness, bad weather, 
industrial dispute, vacation, or other personal reasons. Excluded from the 
employed are people whose only activity consisted of work around the house or 
unpaid volunteer work for religious, charitable, and similar organizations; also 
excluded are all institutionalized people and people on active duty in the 
United States Armed Forces. For the complete definition, go to <A href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/subject_definitions/2020_ACSSubjectDefinitions.pdf">

<P><STRONG>Source and Accuracy</STRONG></P>
<P>This Fact is based on data collected in the American Community Survey (ACS) 
and the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS) conducted annually by the U.S. 
Census Bureau.  A sample of over 3.5 million housing unit addresses is 
interviewed each year over a 12 month period.  This Fact (estimate) is based on 
five years of ACS and PRCS sample data and describes the average value of 
person, household and housing unit characteristics over this period of 
collection.</P>
<P>Statistics from all surveys are subject to sampling and nonsampling error. 
Sampling error is the uncertainty between an estimate based on a sample and the 
corresponding value that would be obtained if the estimate were based on the 
entire population (as from a census).  Measures of sampling error are provided 
in the form of margins of error for all estimates included with ACS and PRCS 
published products. The Census Bureau recommends that data users incorporate 
this information into their analyses, as sampling error in survey estimates 
could impact the conclusions drawn from the results. The data for each 
geographic area are presented together with margins of error at <A href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/training-presentations/acs-moe.html"> 
Using margins of error.</A> A more detailed explanation of margins of error and 
a demonstration of how to use them is provided below.</P>
<P>For more information on sampling and estimation methodology, confidentiality, 
and sampling and nonsampling errors, please see the Multiyear Accuracy (US) and 
the Multiyear Accuracy (Puerto Rico) documents at "Documentation - <A href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html"> 
Accuracy of the data</A>."</P>
<P><STRONG>Margin of Error</STRONG></P>
<P>As mentioned above, ACS estimates are based on a sample and are subject to 
sampling error.  The margin of error measures the degree of uncertainty caused 
by sampling error. The margin of error is used with an ACS estimate to construct 
a confidence interval about the estimate.  The interval is formed by adding the 
margin of error to the estimate (the upper bound) and subtracting the margin of 
error from the estimate (the lower bound).  It is expected with 90 percent 
confidence that the interval will contain the full population value of the 
estimate.  The following example is for demonstrating purposes only. Suppose the 
ACS reported that the percentage of people in a state who were 25 years and 
older with a bachelor's degree was 21.3 percent and that the margin of error 
associated with this estimate was 0.7 percent. By adding and subtracting the 
margin of error from the estimate, we calculate the 90-percent confidence 
interval for this estimate:</P>
<P>21.3% - 0.7% = 20.6% =&gt; Lower-bound estimate <BR> 21.3% + 0.7% = 22.0% 
=&gt; Upper-bound estimate</P>
<P>Therefore, we can be 90 percent confident that the percent of the population 
25 years and older having a bachelor's degree in a state falls somewhere between 
20.6 percent and 22.0 percent.</P>
<P>For this Fact, its estimates and margins of error along with percents and 
percent margins of errors can be found on <A href="https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/data-profiles/">
