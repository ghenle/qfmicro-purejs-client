<P>The Race estimates of the population are produced for the United States, 
states, and counties by the Population Esimates Program and the race estimates 
of the population are produced  for Puerto Rico, muncipios (county-equivalents 
for Puerto Rico), places, zona urbanas and comunidades (place-equivalents for 
Puerto Rico), and minor civil divisions by the American Community Survey. </P>

accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories 
included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of 
race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, 
 anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the 
categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural 
groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial 
mixture, such as "American Indian" and "White." People who identify their origin 
as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.  </P>
<P>OMB requires that race data be collectd for a minimum of five groups: White, 
Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native 
Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.  OMB permits the Census Bureau to also use a 
sixth category - Some Other Race. Respondents may report more than one race. 
</P>
<P><STRONG>The concept of race is separate from the concept of Hispanic 
origin.</STRONG> Percentages for the various race categories add to 100 percent, 
and should not be combined with  the percent Hispanic.</P>
