<p><strong>Source:</strong> U.S. Census Bureau, 2020 Census of Population and Housing, updated every 10 years. <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade.2020.html">Decennial Census by
Decades</a></p>

<p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>

<p>The resident population of a specific geographic location includes all people
living in that location at the time of the census. Since the first decennial
census in 1790, people have been counted at their &quot;usual residence,&quot; which
is the place where they live and sleep most of the time. This place is not always
the same as a person's legal residence, voting residence, or where they prefer
to be counted. </p>

<p>The 2020 Census resident population also includes military and civilian employees
of the U.S. government who are deployed outside the United States (while
stationed or assigned in the United States) and can be allocated to a usual residence
address in the United States based on administrative records from the
Department of Defense.</p>

<p><strong>Scope and Methodology:</strong></p>
