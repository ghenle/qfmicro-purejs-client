<p>The wholesale trade sector comprises establishments engaged in wholesaling merchandise, generally without transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise. The wholesaling process is an intermediate step in the distribution of merchandise. Wholesalers are organized to sell or arrange the purchase or sale of goods for resale (i.e., goods sold to other wholesalers or retailers), capital or durable non-consumer goods, or raw and intermediate materials and supplies used in production. Wholesalers sell merchandise to other businesses and normally operate from a warehouse or office. </p>

<p>The 2012 Economic Census classifies businesses according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), 2012. </p> 

<p>Sales includes merchandise sold for cash or credit by establishments primarily engaged in wholesale trade; receipts from rental of vehicles, equipment, instruments, tools, etc.; receipts for delivery, installation, maintenance, repair, alteration, storage, and other services; gasoline, liquor, tobacco, and other excise taxes that are paid by the manufacturer and passed on to the wholesaler; and shipping and handling receipts. </p> 

<p>Sales are net after deductions for refunds and allowances for merchandise returned by customers. Trade-in allowances are not deducted from sales. Sales do not include carrying or other credit charges; sales and other taxes (including Hawaii's General Excise Tax) collected from customers and forwarded to taxing authorities; and nonoperating income from such sources as investments, rental or sales of real estate, and interest. </p>

<p>Sales do not include wholesale sales made by manufacturers, retailers, service establishments, or other businesses whose primary activity is other than wholesale trade. They do include receipts other than from the sale of merchandise at wholesale, e.g., service receipts, retail sales, etc., by establishments primarily engaged in wholesale trade. </p>
